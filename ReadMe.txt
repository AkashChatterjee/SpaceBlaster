Hello All!

This was my first venture into the LibGdx Java Game Development. 

This was a demo game developed to be used as an example for students of Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal to get an idea of Java Game Development. 

The workshop was conducted by my friend Mr. Mukund Goyal and me, in association with Linux User's Group, Manipal.

Feel free to add to the project. Feedback is always welcome.

P.S : I would like to give Mukund a lot of credit for working with me and enlightening me on various concepts. 

Cheers!
